I minted [my first Noun: 1689](https://nouns.wtf/noun/1689). From now on it will
be my profile picture on all socials.

## Why Nouns?

Using blockchain primitives like block number or block hash to generate art
immediately clicked for me. Yes, you can mint any jaypeg, any digital artefact,
but turning the medium of authenticity (the blockchain) into a creating factor
of the artwork is truly novel. This was also the thought process behind my
(failed?) side projects @lissajous_art and @proofofgroove.

But Nouns is more than that:

- On a technical level, the art is generated and stored onchain. Something that
  pushes the boundary of what a smart contract programming language can (and
  should?) do. We can check where the actual artwork is stored by looking at the
  `tokenURI` read function of any compatible NFT smart contract.
  [Here is what the Nouns one looks like](https://abi.ninja/0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03/1?methods=tokenURI).
- On a legal level, nobody holds any copyright over
  [the artwork](https://nouns.wtf/brand). It is
  [CC0 licenced](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) which means
  everybody can do with it whatever they want. They can print t-shirts, use it
  in videos, create [derivative NFT projects](https://lilnouns.wtf/), etc,
  without asking anybody for permission. The ownership of the Nouns is stored on
  the blockchain. Why bother with copy-rights like other NFT collections do? I
  think this is pretty cool.
- On a societial level: The proceeds of minting a Noun are not making the
  creators aka Nounders rich directly [1]. They go into the treasury of the
  NounsDAO and every holder of a Noun aka Nouner (not to confuse wiht
  Noun**d**er) can vote on proposals how to spend that money. And they do cool
  stuff like [The Nouns Fair](https://nouns.wtf/vote/855), art installations and
  sponsorings of Ethereum events like ETHGlobal hackathons and the upcoming
  DevConnect in Buenos Aires.

Sure, a DAO that manages a big multi million dollar treasury also generates a
lot drama. Like everywhere human beings are involved. The bigger the money the
bigger the potential for drama. To address that, NounsDAO invented a mechanism
to manage the disagreements: [They invented DAO forks](https://nouns.wtf/fork):
If 20% of Nouners disagree, they can initiate a fork and split the treasury
proportionally into a new DAO and then do whatever they want. Pretty
interesting.

## Why now? Aren't NFTs dead?

Hype bubbles have something interesting in common: After they burst, all the
bullshit gets cleaned out but the core value and good ideas survive: The
companies that survived the dotcom bubble defined what the internet is today,
the ICO-bubble survivors are now the key drivers of web3, and Nouns is in my
opinion one of the NFT-bubble survivors who deliver fundamental value. An open
ecosystem that invites one new person to join, every day, forever.

- [1] The Nounders get every 10th Noun sent to their multisig for the first 5
  years. They are vested to align the Nounders incentives with the overall
  success of the project. See: https://nouns.wtf/nounders
