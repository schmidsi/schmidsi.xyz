# Privacy with ENS addresses?

One issue that a lot of people are pointing out with ENS addresses is that they are not private. When you use an ENS address, you are revealing your identity to the world. This is because ENS addresses are public and anyone can look up your address and see your identity. So whenever someone sends money to [ses.eth](https://app.ens.domains/ses.eth), everybody sees that I received some money.

This is a good argument for not using ENS addresses to receive money

Today I learned that ENS name resolution can be dynamic and the geniuses at @fluidkey use that to generate stealth addresses: Every time `ses.fkey.id` is resolved on ENS, a new stealth address is generated in the background. These addresses cannot be traced back to `ses.fkey.id` or `ses.eth` - but I'm in control of them. ðŸ¤¯
