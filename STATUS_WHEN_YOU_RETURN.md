# 👋 Welcome Back!

## 🎉🎉🎉 MIGRATION COMPLETE! (100%)

### ✅ Fully Working
1. **Homepage** - http://localhost:3000
   - Looks identical to production
   - EFP stats loading
   - All social links working
   - Blog post index

2. **RSS Feed** - http://localhost:3000/api/rss
   - Valid XML
   - 2 posts included
   - Auto-updates

3. **Architecture**
   - ✅ Next.js 16.0.1 (App Router)
   - ✅ Nextra completely removed
   - ✅ Tailwind CSS working (fixed!)
   - ✅ Fonts loading (Figtree, Roboto Mono)
   - ✅ TypeScript compiling
   - ✅ Path aliases (@/*) working

### 📝 Documentation Updated
- ✅ AGENTS.md - Added low-dependency philosophy
- ✅ README.md - Updated architecture section
- ✅ Migration plan stored in `docs/issues/001-*`

## ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED!

**Blog posts now working!**
- ✅ `/posts/nouns` - Rendering perfectly
- ✅ `/posts/hello-world` - Rendering perfectly  
- ✅ Tailwind styling applied correctly
- ✅ Production build successful

**Solution:** Replaced `next-mdx-remote` with custom `@mdx-js/mdx` compiler in `lib/mdx.tsx` (~17 lines)  

## 🛠️ How to Fix MDX Issue

### Option 1: Simple Custom MDX Parser (Recommended - 30 min)
Write our own minimal MDX → HTML converter using `@mdx-js/mdx`:

```bash
pnpm add @mdx-js/mdx rehype-highlight remark-gfm
```

Then update `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` to compile MDX ourselves.

### Option 2: Wait for next-mdx-remote Fix
Check if there's a newer version or patch.

### Option 3: Static MDX Imports
Convert to static imports (loses dynamic routing flexibility).

## 🐛 Console Warnings (Non-blocking)

```bash
git checkout main
