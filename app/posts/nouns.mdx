Yesterday, at Ethereum
[block 23642273](https://eth.blockscout.com/tx/0x0f69832d15ef581817de0b73248be25cb02d503f00288b8517fb31285532223a),
I minted [my first Noun: 1689](https://nouns.wtf/noun/1689). From now on it will
be my profile picture on all socials.

## Why Nouns?

Using blockchain primitives like block number or block hash to generate art
immediately clicked for me. Yes, you can mint any JPEG aka jaypeg, any digital
artefact, but turning the blockchain from a ledger into a creative seed is truly
novel. This was also the thought process behind my fizzling side projects
[@lissajous_art](https://twitter.com/lissajous_art) and
[@proofofgroove](https://twitter.com/proofofgroove).

But Nouns is more than that:

- **From a technical perspective**: The art is generated and stored onchain.
  This pushes the boundaries of what a smart contract programming language can
  (and should?) do. We can check where the actual artwork is stored by looking
  at the `tokenURI` read function of any compatible NFT smart contract.
  [Here is what the Nouns one looks like](https://abi.ninja/0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03/1689?methods=tokenURI).
- **From a legal perspective**: Nobody holds any copyright over
  [the artwork](https://nouns.wtf/brand). It is
  [CC0 licensed](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) which means
  everybody can do with it whatever they want. They can print t-shirts, use it
  in videos, create [derivative NFT projects](https://lilnouns.wtf/), etc,
  without asking anybody for permission. The ownership of the Nouns is stored on
  the blockchain. Why bother with copyrights like other NFT collections do? I
  think this is pretty cool.
- **From a societal perspective**: The proceeds of minting a Noun are not making
  the creators aka Nounders rich directly.[^1] They go into the treasury of the
  NounsDAO and every holder of a Noun aka Nouner (not to confuse with
  Noun**d**er) can vote on proposals how to spend that money. And they do cool
  stuff like [The Nouns Fair](https://nouns.wtf/vote/855), art installations and
  sponsorships of Ethereum events like ETHGlobal hackathons and the upcoming
  DevConnect in Buenos Aires.

Sure, a DAO that manages a big multi-million-dollar treasury also generates a
lot of drama. As happens wherever human beings are involved. The bigger the
money the bigger the potential for drama. To address that, NounsDAO invented a
mechanism to manage the disagreements:
[They invented DAO forks](https://nouns.wtf/fork): If 20% of Nouners disagree,
they can initiate a fork and split the treasury proportionally into a new DAO
and then do whatever they want. Pretty interesting.

## Why now? Aren't NFTs dead?

Hype bubbles have something interesting in common: After they burst, all the
bullshit gets cleaned out but the core value and good ideas survive: The
companies that survived the dotcom bubble defined what the internet is today,
the ICO-bubble survivors are now the key drivers of web3, and Nouns is in my
opinion one of the NFT-bubble survivors that delivers fundamental value. An open
ecosystem that invites one new person to join, every day, forever.

## So what?

I think profile pictures (PFPs) are actually still a great usecase of NFTs. I
see a lot of my onchain frens reppin' PFPs. I think the PFP that one chooses
also says a lot about that person. Think about the Bored Apes, the Punks, the
Miladies, the Mfers, the Pudgy Penguins. There is immediately a picture and
feeling about that person. I thought it was time for a new PFP and I started
to look into different projects and just realized more and more that I like
Nouns for the above reasons and I wanted to be a part of it. I started to watch
the auctions a couple of days, loaded my public wallet with enough ETH and then
minted mine. It sounds cheesy but when I saw it, I knew I had to mint it.

And now: I'm a Nouner, let's see where this journey will lead me.

[^1]:
    The Nounders get every 10th Noun sent to their multisig for the first 5
    years. They are vested to align the Nounders incentives with the overall
    success of the project. See: https://nouns.wtf/nounders
